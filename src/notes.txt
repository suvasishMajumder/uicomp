A) Explanantion of :

import React from 'react'

const Button = ({
  children,
  className = '',
  style = {},
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={className}
      style={style}
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

export default Button;


Answer:-


In React, children is a special prop that represents whatever you put between the opening and closing tags of a component.

Example:

Here, "Click Me" is passed as children to the Button component.

Why wrap {children} inside <button>?
This puts whatever you pass between <Button>...</Button> inside the actual button element.
So, the button will display whatever you put as its content.
